# Order of Call for Filing Vacancies

## Introduction

When a dispatcher is absent (vacation, sick, training, etc.), the system needs to fill that vacancy. This document explains in plain language the **order of call** - the exact sequence the system follows to determine who fills the vacancy.

The order of call follows **Article 3(g)** of the Norfolk Southern ATDA collective bargaining agreement. The system always tries to fill vacancies in the most cost-effective way while respecting seniority and contract rules.

## The 7-Step Process

When a vacancy needs to be filled, the system checks these options **in order**, moving to the next step only if the current step doesn't produce a qualified dispatcher:

### Step 1: GAD (Guaranteed Assigned Dispatcher) - Straight Time

**Who gets checked:** The most senior GAD who is qualified for the desk.

**Requirements:**
- Must be qualified for the desk that needs coverage
- Must NOT be on a rest day
- Must NOT be training protected
- Must have enough rest to meet FRA (Federal Railroad Administration) requirements

**Pay:** Straight time (no overtime)

**Why this comes first:** Using a GAD at straight time is the most cost-effective option for the company and is the primary purpose of having GADs.

**Example:** Desk 3 needs coverage on Tuesday. John is a GAD qualified for Desk 3, has Tuesday as a work day, and has had proper rest. John gets assigned at straight time.

---

### Step 2: Incumbent Overtime

**Who gets checked:** The regular job holder for that specific desk/shift.

**Requirements:**
- Must be available (not on vacation, sick, etc.)
- Must meet FRA hours of service requirements
- This is the person whose job assignment is being covered

**Pay:** Overtime

**Why this comes second:** The person who normally works this position knows it best. Asking them to work extra hours is often simpler than reassigning others.

**Example:** Desk 5, 1st shift normally belongs to Sarah. Sarah already worked her regular shift but is available. Sarah gets asked to work overtime to cover her own desk.

---

### Step 3: Senior Rest Day Overtime

**Who gets checked:** The most senior qualified dispatcher who is currently on their rest day.

**Requirements:**
- Must be on their scheduled rest day
- Must be qualified for the desk
- Must meet FRA requirements

**Pay:** Overtime

**Why this comes third:** Seniority matters. More senior employees get first shot at overtime opportunities, even if they're on their rest day.

**Example:** It's Saturday and Desk 2 needs coverage. Mike is the most senior dispatcher qualified for Desk 2, and Saturday is his rest day. Mike gets called for rest day overtime.

---

### Step 4: Junior Same-Shift Diversion (with GAD Backfill)

**Who gets checked:** The most junior (least senior) dispatcher working on the same shift but on a different desk.

**Special requirement:** A GAD must be available to backfill the position that this dispatcher leaves.

**Pay:** Depends on GAD baseline (see "Understanding GAD Baseline" below)

**Why this comes fourth:** Moving someone from the same shift is simpler than calling someone from a different shift. We take the most junior to preserve seniority rights. The GAD fills their vacated desk.

**Example:** On 2nd shift, Desk 1 needs coverage. Lisa is the most junior dispatcher on 2nd shift (working Desk 4). A GAD is available to cover Desk 4. Lisa moves to Desk 1, GAD covers Desk 4.

---

### Step 5: Junior Same-Shift Diversion (no GAD Backfill)

**Who gets checked:** The most junior dispatcher on the same shift.

**Special note:** This creates a cascade vacancy - the desk they leave becomes vacant and needs to be filled through the same process.

**Pay:** Depends on GAD baseline

**Why this comes fifth:** If no GAD is available to backfill, we still prefer same-shift movement but accept that it creates another vacancy to fill.

**Example:** Same as Step 4, but no GAD is available. Lisa moves to Desk 1, and Desk 4 now needs to go through the order of call process.

---

### Step 6: Senior Off-Shift Diversion (with GAD Backfill)

**Who gets checked:** The most senior dispatcher working on a different shift.

**Special requirement:** A GAD must be available to backfill their position.

**Pay:** Depends on GAD baseline

**Why this comes sixth:** Moving someone between shifts is more disruptive. We use the most senior qualified dispatcher out of respect for seniority.

**Example:** Desk 3 on 1st shift needs coverage. Tom is the most senior dispatcher qualified for Desk 3, currently working 3rd shift on Desk 2. A GAD covers Tom's Desk 2 position, Tom moves to 1st shift Desk 3.

---

### Step 7: Least Cost Fallback

**Who gets checked:** All qualified dispatchers, using actual cost calculations.

**How it works:** The system calculates the actual cost (including overtime rates, shift differentials, etc.) for every possible option and selects the cheapest one.

**Pay:** Varies based on the specific assignment

**Why this comes last:** If none of the above steps work, the system does a comprehensive analysis to find the most cost-effective solution while still respecting contract rules.

**Example:** After checking all the above options without success, the system calculates that calling in Dispatcher Alex from home at overtime is cheaper than other available options.

## Key Concepts Explained

### What is a GAD?

**GAD** stands for **Guaranteed Assigned Dispatcher**. GADs are part of an unassigned pool specifically used to fill vacancies.

**Key facts about GADs:**
- They are NOT assigned to a specific desk permanently
- They work on a rotating rest day schedule (Groups A through G)
- They can be used at straight time when the company is above the "GAD baseline"
- Using a GAD at straight time is always the first choice for filling vacancies

**GAD Rest Day Groups:**
- **Group A:** Sunday-Monday off
- **Group B:** Monday-Tuesday off
- **Group C:** Tuesday-Wednesday off
- **Group D:** Wednesday-Thursday off
- **Group E:** Thursday-Friday off
- **Group F:** Friday-Saturday off
- **Group G:** Saturday-Sunday off

### Understanding Seniority

**Seniority** determines who has priority in various situations:

- **Most senior** = hired earliest, has the lowest seniority rank number
- **Most junior** = hired most recently, has the highest seniority rank number

**When seniority matters:**
- **Most senior gets called first** for: GAD assignments, rest day overtime, off-shift diversions
- **Most junior gets called first** for: same-shift diversions (to protect senior rights)

---

### Understanding GAD Baseline

The **GAD baseline** is a calculation that determines whether diversions (moving dispatchers around) get paid at straight time or overtime.

**How it's calculated:**
- Baseline = 1.0 GAD per desk
- Example: If there are 11 desks, the baseline is 11.0 GADs

**How it affects pay:**
- **Above baseline** (e.g., 12 GADs for 11 desks): Diversions are paid straight time
- **At or below baseline** (e.g., 10 GADs for 11 desks): Diversions are paid overtime

**Why this matters:** This is part of the contract agreement (Appendix 9) to ensure fair compensation when dispatchers are moved around to fill vacancies.

---

### What is FRA Hours of Service?

The **Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)** sets limits on how many hours railroad employees can work:

- **Maximum duty time:** 9 hours for regular dispatchers, 12 hours for ACD (Assistant Chief Train Dispatcher)
- **Minimum rest:** 15 hours between shifts

**Why this matters:** The system automatically checks that any assignment won't violate these safety rules. A dispatcher who doesn't have enough rest time cannot be assigned, even if they would otherwise be next in the order of call.

---

### What is the Extra Board?

The **Extra Board** is another unassigned pool of dispatchers, similar to GADs but with a different rotating rest day system.

**Key facts:**
- Three classes (Class 1, 2, and 3) with staggered rest day schedules
- Rest days rotate on a 6-week cycle
- Designed to ensure there's always coverage available

**Rest day rotation pattern (repeats every 6 weeks):**
- Week 1: Sat/Sun
- Week 2: Sun/Mon
- Week 3: Mon/Tue
- Week 4: Tue/Wed
- Week 5: Wed/Thu
- Week 6: Thu/Fri

Each class starts at a different point in this cycle, so when one class is off on weekends, others are available.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Vacation Coverage

**Situation:** Regular dispatcher on Desk 5, 1st shift is on vacation Monday through Friday.

**What happens:**
1. System checks for available GAD qualified for Desk 5 → Finds one
2. GAD covers Monday-Friday at straight time
3. Regular dispatcher returns next week

---

### Scenario 2: Sick Call with Limited GAD Availability

**Situation:** Dispatcher calls in sick for Desk 2, 3rd shift. No GADs are available (all working or on rest days).

**What happens:**
1. Step 1 (GAD) → None available
2. Step 2 (Incumbent OT) → Sick dispatcher can't work
3. Step 3 (Rest Day OT) → Most senior qualified dispatcher on rest day gets called
4. That dispatcher works overtime

---

### Scenario 3: Multiple Simultaneous Vacancies

**Situation:** Three dispatchers out sick on the same day.

**What happens:**
1. System processes each vacancy independently through the order of call
2. First vacancy uses the first available GAD
3. Second vacancy uses the second available GAD
4. Third vacancy (if no more GADs) moves to Step 2, then Step 3, etc.
5. Each vacancy is filled using the earliest possible step in the order

---

### Scenario 4: Training Protection

**Situation:** Desk 1 needs coverage, but the most senior qualified GAD is marked as "training protected."

**What happens:**
1. System skips the training-protected dispatcher
2. Moves to the next most senior GAD
3. If no other GADs are available, continues through Steps 2-7

**Note:** Training protected dispatchers are usually excluded unless there are absolutely no other options.

---

## Important Rules and Exceptions

### Who Gets Excluded from the Order of Call?

These dispatchers are automatically excluded:
- Dispatchers on scheduled rest days (except in Step 3, rest day overtime)
- Training-protected dispatchers (unless no other options exist)
- Dispatchers who don't have enough rest time (FRA violations)
- Dispatchers not qualified for the specific desk
- Inactive dispatchers (on leave, suspended, etc.)

### Penalties for Violations

**Improper diversion penalty:** If the company fails to follow the order of call correctly, the affected dispatcher receives a **4-hour straight-time penalty** payment.

### Qualification Requirements

A dispatcher can only be assigned to a desk if they are **qualified** for it. Qualification is tracked in the system and typically involves:
- Completing training for that desk type
- Being marked as qualified by management
- Maintaining current qualification status
